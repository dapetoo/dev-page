# Deeper understanding of data structures

The Federal Polytechnic, Ilaro has helped me to understand more important concepts that's required to be successful in the world of IT, as a young IT professional that is learning virtually almost everything online and meetups, I don't really take learning data structures and algorithm serious, but I learnt that good software developers don't just write code that works but looks for the most effective way on how to save memory. 

I have been able to connect with awesome people in the school community and this has helped me to grow exponentially and learnt more about different fields that are available in the IT field. I have come to learnt that IT can be use to drive any field/business in order to improve human life and the society at large.
