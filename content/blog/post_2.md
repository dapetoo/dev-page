# Deeper understanding of data structures

The Federal Polytechnic, Ilaro has helped me to understand more important concepts that's required to be successful in the world of IT, as a young IT professional that is learning virtually almost everything online and meetups, I don't really take learning data structures and algorithm serious, but I learnt that good software developers don't just write code that works but looks for the most effective way on how to save memory. 

I have been able to connect with awesome people in the school community and this has helped me to grow exponentially and learnt more about different fields that are available in the IT field. I have come to learnt that IT can be use to drive any field/business in order to improve human life and the society at large.

I found some of the listed courses interesting because it has really helped me to have a deeper understanding of how computer works.

1. Operating System: It’s hard to write good software without understanding the software that your software runs on. Just like an understanding of CPU architecture, a good knowledge of how operating systems work will make you a valuable asset to any organization. Most developers only have a cursory knowledge of how Linux operates, and if you deploy on Linux like most of the world, your expertise will be well-rewarded.

2. Algorithms and Data Structures: The study of algorithms and data structures is the bread and butter of computer science. It’s fundamental that we learn about making computer programs fast so that they can delight our users and find meaningful answers quickly.

    I’m in complete agreement with the traditional education system that that familiarity with common algorithms and data structures is vital to the success of any developer. Understanding these basic problem-solving skills will also benefit you in any aspect of your career and life.

3. Computer Architecture and Hardware: Computer architecture is arguable the most overlooked subject among the bootcamp and self-taught developer community. It’s almost impossible to write performant and efficient software without a basic understanding of the hardware it runs on.

    Computers are built of various components (hardware) including the CPU, memory, busses, clocks, and the peripheral devices you are familiar with like the mouse and keyboard. All of these components must communicate with each other and provide a necessary service to the user, but as software developers, the most important components for us to understand are memory (RAM) and the processor (CPU).
