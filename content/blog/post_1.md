# Information Technology

I am interested in studying computer science because I find it fascinating. When I was about to finishe my SSCE,I remembered visiting a sister, she has this big desktop in her house with Angry bird game installed on it, I love playing the game. I was initially drawn to them because I fancied computer games. 

However, the more I operated with computers, the more I began to appreciate understanding how they work, discovering just how much they can do and the near limitless potential they hold. I can always remember the feeling of wanting to know just how computers worked, why they worked and what else they could do. 

My journey into the IT world started after my SSCE where I enrolled to learn Desktop Publishing which covers the basics such as how to interact with the operating system, Microsoft Office suite and Graphics Design. After two months into my program, I learnt that the institute is running a 50percent discount for their professional programs, I met with my instructor to guide me through on the prerequisite knowledge for the professional courses, I had interest in Web Design, SPSS, AutoCad etc. 

The meeting with my instructor opened my eyes to what opportunities lies ahead for those in the IT field, during our meeting he mentioned a term HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), and I could remembered using my phone to search for the term, and I discovered the site https://w3schools.com. I learnt the bascis of HTML, CSS and some programming languages on the website. I did not enrolled for any professional course but I made a decision to study Computer Science in higher institution.
